# Improved Unity Animation Events

![AnimationEvents](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3b9e80-1533-454b-b551-78ff8d92169f)

This repository provides an enhanced and flexible system for managing **Animation Events** in Unity, with a focus on improving event configuration, previewing, and triggering during animation playback. The system builds on Unity's existing animation workflow and provides developers with more control over how events are handled and integrated.

## Key Features:
- **Custom Animation Events**: Easily configure and trigger animation events based on a specific time (normalized between 0 and 1) during an animation state.
- **Event Receiver**: A flexible event receiver component that allows animation events to trigger UnityEvents in a reusable and maintainable way.
- **Inspector Preview Mode**: Preview animations directly in the Unity Editor's Scene view, allowing for a more efficient workflow.
- **T-Pose Enforcement**: Quickly reset characters to their default T-pose for animation rigging and debugging.
- **State Machine Behaviour Integration**: Events are managed via `StateMachineBehaviour`, allowing event triggers based on specific animation states.

This system aims to improve the flexibility and control over Unityâ€™s Animation Event system, making it easier to manage complex animation event scenarios in-game or during editor-time workflows.
